# Project Insight:

This interactive web application allows users to access information on movies and their directors and respective genres. Users are able to sign up, make updates to their personal information, and create their own list of their favorite movies.

## Project Criteria
In this module I learned and created my very own REST API via the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React and Node.js)
While I used Mongo, Express, and Node.js for the server side of my application, React will later be introduced to create a fluid client and server-side Movie application.

### Users
Users of this application may include avid movie fans and/or frontend developers who will apply their client-side work directly to the server-side framework.

### What the Server-Side includes:
This complete application consists of a well-designed REST API and architeched database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API is accesible via GET/POST methods (CRUD) that retrieves data from my database and stores it in a non-relational way.

### REST API in use:
Once logged in, Users can expect to have results from their interactions to be processed and operations performed on the server-side through a series of requests and responses being checked in the database.

### Authorization & Authentication
I have included password hashing, JWT Passport Authentication, and included validation logic throughout my app to protect User's information and data from being compromised. The only endpoint without the JWT Passport token being "/", due to it needing to be 'READ' by all users.

### Where to View
MyFlix is hosted online through Heroku and imported via MongoAtlas for a more secure, fast runtime environment that can be easily accessed by any server.

### Summary
This project was a huge learning experience for me as an aspiring developer. Using multiple layers of unfamiliar software programs to create something from scratch is alltogether challenging, daunting, and fun! I enjoyed every challenege along the way, and I leanred that creating databases is something I take great interest in! I am excited to share my new skills as I am continually on a learning journey in the world of development!
